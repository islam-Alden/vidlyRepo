# Vidly

## Introduction

**Vidly** is a full-stack application that leverages the YouTube API v3 to create a feature-rich video experience. It enables users to search for videos, live streams, and playlists, analyze video comments for sentiment, and manage their favorite videos using a PostgreSQL database. I built Vidly to transform my knowledge into a practical tool that benefits others and showcases my skills in modern full-stack development.
